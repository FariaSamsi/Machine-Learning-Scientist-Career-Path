#Chapter 1: Python Basics
- Guido Van Russo
- General purpose: build anything
- Open source! Free!
- Python packages, for Data Science
#### ipython shell
- runs commands interactively
## Python scripts
- Text files with the extension .py
- List of Python commands that are executed
- To add comments to the Python script, use the # tag
- Use print() to generate output from the script
### Operations
- Addition, subtraction: +, -
- Multiplication, division: *,/
- modulo: returns remainder: %
- Exponentiation: **. This operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right.
### Variables
- variable: a specific, case-sensitive name.
- a variable allows you to refer to a value with a name.
- After declaring a variable, you can later call up its value by typing the variable name.
- Variables help to make your code reproducible.
### Python data types
- Check out the type of a value with the type function.
- float type: Real number, can have both an integer p;;art and a fraction part
- int type: Integer number
- String: String is Python's way of representing text.
- bool: True or False, logical value. (The capitalization is important!).
- For different data types, operators behave differently.
### Variable Assignment
- x = 5
- = in Python means assignment, it doesn't test equality!
###Type conversion
- Using the + operator to paste together two strings can be very useful in building custom messages. This is called the concatenation of string.
- can only concatenate str with string, not "int" to str. So to concatenate an int to string, first you have to do type conversion of int to str.
- functions such as int(), float(), str() and bool() will help you convert Python values into any type.
